-Compare code output to ones from manual
-start playing with code (use different parameters and get a feel for what adding just phase will do and then amplitude modulation)
-combine amp and phase
-add functionality for stored waveforms (will need to read through manual a bit)
-make sure things working for our wavelength of interest (see what kind of sampling this requires)
-transform output from dazzler code to spectrogram (look up FROG, we can discuss FROG retrieval too sometime)
-if finished with this and can't think of other things you want to explore with this, we may start playing around with CNNs


-SFG
-first play with Randy's code in Matlab. Start getting familiar with its functionality (we can work a little together on this if need be...im rusty on his code too)
-start building python class based on the function in matlab
-compare performance in python to matlab performance
-implement compatibility with other code
	-this will require first understanding the input field type for the current code
	-then will need to work on matching output form (spectral intensity and phase) from dazzler/RA to this form
